# OutsideHacks2017
Ranger Dave's Concert Games (2017)

Project created by Jack Van Boening, Mustafa Qazi, and Chibuikem Ohanale at Outside Hacks 2018. The app allows concert goers to draft 
a line-up of their favorite aritsts, and compete against their peers to gain the most points. Artists are ranked into tiers, and each
user must draft their line-up with a certain number of artists in each tier; similar to fantasy sports leagues.
